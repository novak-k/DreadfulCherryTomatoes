## Layout
1. The layout was created based on flex design following React component principle. 
2. The component named 'Logo' was created as a separated coz it was used twice in the code. 
3. Other components were created based on the functional logic of each.
4. To create pagination I used a opensource React componet `react-paginate`.

## Logic
1. To be able to manage the state, which is needed to filter movies, I used Redux. 
2. The store contains fetched movies from API and manages to operate with search logic.
